# TO DO

- add all questions and answers into json file for data
- get the page to render a random set of 65 questions
- add an option for a timer (once the timer runs out, you take the to the results page - somehow you need to save state all the time/cache - look into it)
- program state with zustand for the correct answer and results
- add a results page
- add a score component to the page (as the user goes through questions, with a final result) + question tracker
- a feature to enable users to leave the test early - mark all unanswered questions as zero
- allow users to be able to go back to last question (?!)
- add styling
- add testing
- deploy
